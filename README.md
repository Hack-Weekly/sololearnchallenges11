# Sololearn Coding Challenges

There are 72 or more problems from **SoloLearn Code Coach**. Over a period of 30 days or less, I aim to solve all these problems.
The problems are grouped by dificulty: Easy, Medium, Hard.

I will attempt 2 Easy, 1 Medium and 1 Hard problem each day and keep updating the README.md to reflect these changes.

Every problem will be found under the directory based on it's difficulty level.

Each problem will have a different directory that will comprise a README.md explaining the challenge.

To begin with, first round of solving these problems will be done in Python, then in C, then C++ and then more programming languages if possible.

The codes will be written on mobile device in Sololearn sandbox, sucessfully run and will pass all test cases provided by Sololearn. The link to my profile at Sololearn: https://www.sololearn.com/profile/29143180
